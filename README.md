# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** solutions repository! This project contains my Python-based solutions for the daily coding challenges provided during the Advent of Code event.

## Project Structure

Each day's challenge is organized into its own folder:

```
ðŸ“‚ day-01
   â”œâ”€â”€ part1.py   # Solution for Part 1
   â”œâ”€â”€ part2.py   # Solution for Part 2
   â””â”€â”€ input.txt  # Puzzle input

ðŸ“‚ day-02
   â”œâ”€â”€ part1.py
   â”œâ”€â”€ part2.py
   â””â”€â”€ input.txt

ðŸ“‚ utils
   â””â”€â”€ parser.py  # Script for processing input files
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A-Georgiou/advent-of-code.git
   cd advent-of-code-2024
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder of the desired day (e.g., `cd day-01`) and run the solution scripts:
   ```bash
   python part1.py
   python part2.py
   ```

3. Customize and utilize the utilities in the `utils` folder to parse inputs or streamline your workflow.
